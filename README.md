Hello guys,
Please keep in mind I dont have strong experience in React.js, for the moment its my third small app I ever made using React.js.

I spent on this project about 4 hours including reading documentation writing code and searching for solutions if my code didn't not work =)

I made it as close as possible to the Hacker News pages. Of cause there are a lot of things to improve but I believe its not the part of this test.
